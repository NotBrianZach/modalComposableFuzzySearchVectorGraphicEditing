WIP

steps to compile this:
1. install cmake, this is for inkscape
2. run cmake in inkscape/inkscape-launchpad, 
2.5 when it fails, read cmake readme, install dependencies, fix it.
3. successfully compile emacs lisp foreign function interface
4. Uhm stuff, idk?
probably start off by trying to match up files from 
evil that look like they'll be useful or have analagous roles
to "matching" functions/files in inkscape,
assemble a loose directory structure



Design: come up with modes, document which other modes they should
be composable with:

cartesian navigation mode hjkl = west, north, south, east
ability to set default unit in terms of pixels or of elements
of the vector drawing
composes with:
numeric prefixes


polar navigation mode = hjkl = clockwise rotation,  
ability to set default unit in terms of pixels, degrees, radians,
or of elements of the vector drawing
composes with:
numeric prefixes
visual selection mode


command mode = ex mode in vi, used to issue commands
composable with: nothing, or is it?


visual selection mode = 
pre-requisite:
navigation mode to allow
for selecting objects
composes with: 


geometric modes:
leverage geometric knowledge to allow for 
more powerful visual editing 

triangle mode:
inherits from polygon mode

square mode:
inherits from polygon mode
more powerful square specific keybindings
composes with:
navigation mode to allow you to move the square around or modify
specific parts of the square e.g. a corner

polygon mode: allows you to make modification
to polygon based on the median point

bezier curve mode:

polynomial mode?:
